# Sentiment-Classifier
This program detects the emotions/context associated with an input sentence, and prints out emojis to represent them! Trained on an RNN model.

The dataset is quite small, but feel free to expand! Words outside of the training set are not included in the embedding dictionary that's created, and thus will be erased- be cautious in using uncommon words!

E.g. "John wants food" will be read by the program as "wants food"
